The Master_Notebook.ipynb contains the mathematical theory behind the model, followed by the code that makes up the model.

The actual model consists of the five Python (.py) scripts, which include the same code detailed in the Master Notebook, but in a more refined form.

The Example_Usage.ipynb explains each .py script and provides several examples demonstrating how to use the model. Additionally, a template notebook called Template.ipynb has been provided, with the model already initialized for easy use.

A copy of my thesis has also been included in the repository, offering the academic background and context for which the model was developed (Marine Particle Aggregation). The data used for the thesis can be found in the Thesis_Notebook.ipynb.
